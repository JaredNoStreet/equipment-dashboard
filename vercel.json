# Heavy Equipment Market Dashboard

## Deploy to Vercel (one-time setup, ~5 minutes)

### Option A: Drag & Drop (no account needed initially)
1. Go to vercel.com
2. Click "Start Deploying"
3. Drag this entire `equipment-dashboard` folder onto the page
4. Vercel builds it and gives you a live URL (e.g. equipment-dashboard-abc123.vercel.app)
5. Share that URL with your team

### Option B: GitHub (recommended for easy updates)
1. Create a free GitHub account at github.com
2. Create a new repository called `equipment-dashboard`
3. Upload all files in this folder to that repo
4. Go to vercel.com → "Import Project" → connect your GitHub repo
5. Vercel auto-deploys — every time you push updated files, the live URL refreshes automatically

## Updating the Dashboard

**With Claude:** Share the .jsx file (App.jsx) and say "update the dashboard with [month] data."
Claude will edit the data arrays at the top of App.jsx and return the updated file.
Then replace App.jsx in your repo/folder and redeploy.

**Manually:** Open src/App.jsx — all data is in clearly labeled arrays near the top of the file.
Find the array for the metric you want to update, add the new month's values, save, redeploy.

## Files
- `src/App.jsx` — the entire dashboard (all data lives here)
- `src/index.js` — React entry point (don't edit)
- `public/index.html` — HTML shell (don't edit)
- `package.json` — dependencies (don't edit)
